## Creating a JAR ##
I didn't have any luck with getting ```mvn``` to automatically creat the jar file for me, so in Eclipse I just used:

1. Export
2. Java/Runnable JAR File
3. Library handling should just be "Package required libraries into generated JAR"
4. Finish

## Launching globally##
1. Put the JAR from above somewhere easy, like in your applications folder
